1.2.7 Evaluation

Children's safety and happiness should be a major focus of modern society. More often than not, these issues are either ignored or addressed as a passing trend. This site is intent on bringing awareness towards the cause, hopefully providing a means of support for those less fortunate, who nonetheless deserve the same chance at happiness and safety. One of my main concerns is children's education, which is often next to nonexistent in developing nations and those suffering from humanitarian crises, where treatable diseases and war still pose a great risk. Children are among the most affected groups in the aforementioned situations, and so I am attempting to provide the means for people to aid them in whatever way they can.

The site has been tested on both desktop and mobile devices, in order to ensure its compatibility with them. I have employed a mobile-first approach, building for functionality and the effective delivery of content. I have found that, for mobile devices, content matters a great deal more than on desktop, where you can make use of other features in order to mask design shortcomings.

The design choices were inspired by other, established children's charities such as Save the Children. The overall design is intended to be minimalistic and offer as much content as possible. While the design might lack refined and complex visuals, the content matter is poignant enough to attract initial attention in hopes of fostering long-time interest in the subject matter.
